## What is the @goodfirstissue Bot?

@**gfibot(goodfirstissue)** is a GitHub bot designed to help open-source projects attract and engage new contributors. It does this by tweeting about unassigned and open issues that are labeled as "good first issue." This selective notification approach allows potential contributors to easily find beginner-friendly tasks without the clutter of irrelevant updates.

### How @gfibot Works

**The bot operates through two main components:**

1. **GitHub Bot:**
   - **Installation:** The @goodfirstissue bot is installed on a GitHub organization or repository.
   - **Monitoring:** It listens for specific GitHub events, particularly when new issues are tagged with the "good first issue" label.
   - **Filtering:** The bot checks if the issue is unassigned and open, ensuring that itâ€™s suitable for new contributors.
   - **Notification:** It then sends this information to a processing function which filters out any non-relevant issues.

2. **Twitter Handle:**
   - **Real-Time Alerts:** The processed and filtered issue details are tweeted through the [@gfibot](https://twitter.com/gfibot) Twitter handle.
   - **Audience:** Potential first-time contributors follow this Twitter handle to receive real-time notifications about these beginner-friendly issues.
